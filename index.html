<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Daniel Moore, an Economics Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. I study topics in labor such as migration, working arrangements, and intergenerational mobility. 
  Broadly, I am interested in labor economics, causal inference, machine learning, and policy evaluation. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me at dfmoore@uw.edu if you have any questions!

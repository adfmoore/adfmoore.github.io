          <h3>Passing the Buck: The Effects of a Targeted Tax Cut for Pass-Through Businesses</h3>
          <p>
            What are the effects of tax cuts for business owners on the labor market? Exploiting a change in Kansas state tax policy, this paper examines the labor market effects of eliminating taxes on pass-through income.
            I find that the tax cut reduced total employment by 2.3%, with smaller declines among pass-through businesses. Despite lower employment at pass-through firms, total payroll among these businesses did not fall, resulting in higher average earnings.
            In contrast, non-profit organizations experienced the largest employment declines. Further, the relative share of pass-through businesses increased following the reform.
            Together, these results suggest that tax reductions do not necessarily stimulate hiring and may instead induce organizational reallocation.

          <h3>The Compensating Differentials of Remote Work</h3>
          <p>
            Remote work has become increasingly common following the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in high-skill industries. Using longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation, I estimate the compensating wage differential between remote and in-person work. Exploiting workers who switch between remote and in-person arrangements, I use a Bayesian causal forest approach to flexibly model wage dynamics while isolating within-worker treatment effects and allowing for heterogeneous responses across occupations and demographic groups.
